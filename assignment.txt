GOAL: find out if the EZ diffusion model can be used to estimate parameters from data that were generated by the EZ diffusion model


Steps and Logic
1: Randomly select a, v, and t
    Boundary separation a between 0.5 and 2
    Drift rate v between 0.5 and 2
    Nondecision time t between 0.1 and 0.5

2: State N (sample size)
    For N, use 10, 40, and 4000 (so in total 3 x 1000 simulate-and-recover iterations)

3: EZ Diffusion simulations
    First, generate 'predicted' summary statistics (Rpred, Mpred, Vpred)
    Second, simulate 'observed' summary statistics (Robs, Mobs, Vobs)
    Third, calculate 'estimated' parameters (v^est, a^est, t^est)

4: Compute estimation bias (b)
