# EZ Diffusion Model Simulate-and-Recover

This project implements a simulate-and-recover exercise for the diffusion model, a cognitive model used in decision-making research. The goal is to test whether the EZ diffusion model can estimate parameters from data that were generated by the same model.

## Introduction
In this exercise, we simulate decision-making data using the EZ diffusion model, and then apply the same model to recover the parameters. We test if the EZ diffusion model can recover parameters reliably, with consistency between true and estimated values. This is done for different sample sizes (N = 10, 40, 4000) over 1000 iterations.

The model parameters are:
- **Boundary separation (a)** between 0.5 and 2
- **Drift rate (v)** between 0.5 and 2
- **Nondecision time (t)** between 0.1 and 0.5

The simulate-and-recover process is repeated for three different sample sizes (N) to analyze the impact of sample size on parameter recovery.

## Setup
To run this project, you need Python 3 and the following dependencies:
- `os`
- `sys`
- `src`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

## Results
I struggled a lot with the premise of the assignment and spent much time figuring out the formatting of my files. I was able to use the documentation from the class and different libraries to help me figure out calculations. I learned about the importance of research and trial and error. Organization of the testing files helped a lot in error finding and also being able to go step by step using Jupyter as a basis helped a lot.
I was able to get my code to go through each equation and output the bias and squared errors. Through the process, finding out how I can submit a
